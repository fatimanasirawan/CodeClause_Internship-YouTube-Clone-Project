# CodeClause_Internship-YouTube-Clone-Project
ðŸš€ Completed my third project during my internship at Code Clause: A YouTube Clone ðŸŽ¥

During my internship at Code Clause, I had the exciting opportunity to work on a hands-on project that allowed me to put my HTML and CSS skills to the test. I successfully created a YouTube Clone, replicating the user interface and experience of the popular video-sharing platform.

Key Achievements:
âœ… Developed a fully responsive web application that mirrors the layout and design of YouTube.
âœ… Implemented HTML and CSS to craft an engaging and user-friendly interface.
âœ… Ensured cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness for a seamless viewing experience.
âœ… Gained valuable experience in web development and front-end design principles.

This project not only deepened my understanding of web development but also honed my ability to work collaboratively in a team environment. I am proud of the skills I've gained and look forward to applying them to future projects.
